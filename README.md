# Virtual-Assistant
This repository contains the code and resources for a basic virtual assistant designed to help users with simple tasks. The virtual assistant is built using Python and leverages libraries such as speech_recognition, pyttsx3, and datetime to perform tasks like voice recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and basic time-based queries.
